          Maths Racer is an online browser based game which has been designed
          and created to assist Primary School Children to practice their Times
          Tables. The idea is to provide some fun in the learning process so
          that it's engaging for children and helps push them to improve both
          the speed and accuracy of the answers to the times table questions.
