      <h3>Maths Racer</h3>
      <p>Maths Racer is an online browser based game which has been designed and created to assist Primary 
        School Children to practice their Times Tables. The idea is to provide some fun in the learning process 
        so that it's engaging for children and helps push them to improve both the speed and accuracy of the answers 
        to the times table questions.</p>
